`ParaMag.jl` is a Julia package for the simulation of magnetic properties of open-shell paramagnetic molecules.
Currently, two different computational models are supported: Spin Hamiltonians and ligand field theory.

A specialty of the code are higher-order derivatives of the Helmholtz free energy, which arise in the form of hypersusceptibilities and in the context of describing field-dependent chemical shieldings in NMR spectra of paramagnetic molecules.
